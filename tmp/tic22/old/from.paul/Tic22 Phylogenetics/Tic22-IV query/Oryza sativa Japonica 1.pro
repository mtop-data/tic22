COMMENT     Genes were predicted from the integrated results of the following:
            GENSCAN (http://CCR-081.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html), FGENESH
            (http://www.softberry.com/), GeneMark.hmm
            (http://opal.biology.gatech.edu/GeneMark/), GlimmerM
            (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/glimmerm/glmr_form.html), RiceHMM
            (http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/RiceHMM/), SplicePredictor
            (http://bioinformatics.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/sp.cgi), sim4
            (http://globin.cse.psu.edu/html/docs/sim4.html), gap2
            (http://www.tigr.org/software/glimmerm/), BLASTN and BLASTX. The
            genomic sequence was searched against NCBI NonRedundant Protein
            database, nr (ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db) and the cDNA
            sequence database at RGP or DDBJ. Protein homologies of the coding
            regions were searched against NCBI NonRedundant Protein database
            with BLASTP. ESTs represent the identified cDNA sequences using
            BLASTN with the corresponding DDBJ accession no. and RGP clone ID.
            Full-length cDNAs represent the identified cDNA sequences using
            BLASTN with the corresponding DDBJ accession no.
            A gene with identity or significant homology to a protein is
            classified based on the protein name to indicate the homology level
            such as same name, 'putative-' and '-like protein'.  A gene without
            significant homology to any protein but with full-length cDNA or
            EST homology (covering almost the entire length of partial
            sequence) is classified as an 'unknown' protein. A gene predicted
            by two or more gene prediction programs is classified as a
            'hypothetical' protein according to IRGSP standard. A gene
            predicted by a single gene prediction program is also classified as
            a probable 'hypothetical' protein and is included as a
            miscellaneous feature of the sequence.
            The orientation of the sequence is from SP6 to T7 of the PAC clone.
            This sequence of P0701E03 clone has an overlap with P0021C04 clone
            (DDBJ: AP004687) at 5' end and an overlap with P0537F07 (DDBJ:
            AP003525) at 3' end. Detailed information on overlap and assembly
            quality together with annotation of this entry is available at
            http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/GenomeSeq.html.
